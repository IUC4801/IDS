# Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning Algorithms

## About The Project

This IDS project aims to detect and predict network intrusions using machine learning. The IDS is used to distinguish between 'bad connections' (intrusions/attacks) and a 'good (normal) connections' after applying some feature extraction on KDD Cup 1999 dataset by DARPA.

## Features

- Five different machine learning algorithms are used.
- The performance of all the algorithms is examined based on accuracy and computational times.
- KDD Cup 1999 dataset has been used for training and testing of the model.
- Derived results show that Random Forest outperforms the best on measures like Accuracy and Computational Time.


## Tech Stack

- Python 3.9 and Jupyter Notebook have been used.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IUC4801/TDS.git
   ```
   
2. After cloning the repository, go to the `IDS` folder and open Jupyter Notebook.

### Evaluation

The IDS was evaluated using KDD Cup 1999 dataset by DARPA dataset. The whole dataset can be downloaded from- http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html The model achieved an accuracy of 99.997% for Random Forest algorithm.
